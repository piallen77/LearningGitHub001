# LearningGitHub001

This is the description for the readme file. And I am adding more.
Now that I am writing more, I guess we will see what happens.

If I wanted to, I could use github as a storage location for writing. I mean, I could write stories here -- virtually anything I want. I LOVE that. It's pretty cool to be able to merge more than just code.
